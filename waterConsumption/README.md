## Challenges

1) Change the code so that it prints out the waterConsumptionRawData array
2) Change the code so that it creates just the header for our Water Consumption Data (hint: there's a function that does most of this for you)
3) Change the code so that it also populates the table with Water Consumption Data

##### Water Consumption data from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Water-Consumption-In-The-New-York-City/ia2d-e54m
